# ssNMR_DriveCaps

This folder is meant to share the CAD file of Bruker type ssNMR drive caps. 

The fin of 0.7 mm drive cap is scaled down from a 2.5 mm fin design. Dimensions of the drive cap are estimated from Bruker 0.7 mm drive cap.

stl files of Ultracentrifuge tools are also included in this folder:
with 1 piece, 2 piece, and 3 piece design.
Can be printed with Formlab 3+ with Clear V4 resin.
1 piece was tested and can maintain good hydration level of biomolecular samples, however, a small groove needs to be drilled on the edge of the rotor hole in order to pick up the rotor out of the tool with sharp end tweezers.
